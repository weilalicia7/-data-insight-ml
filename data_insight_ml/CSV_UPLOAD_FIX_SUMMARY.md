# CSV Upload ID and Name Display - Fix Summary

## Issue
When uploading CSV files with IDs and names through the demo interface, the prediction results showed generic labels like "Record 1", "Record 2" instead of displaying the actual IDs and names from the CSV.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend (app.py)
**Modified upload_predict endpoint** (lines 483-518)

**Before:**
- All columns containing "id" anywhere in the name were dropped
- Name columns were also lost during processing
- Results had no identifying information

**After:**
- ID columns (ending with `_id` or exactly `id`) are preserved
- Name columns (ending with `_name` or exactly `name`) are preserved
- Identifiers are extracted before prediction and added to each result
- Each result now contains an `identifiers` field with ID and name

**Example Result:**
```json
{
  "confidence": 0.6769654835787958,
  "domain": "student_dropout",
  "identifiers": {
    "student_id": "STU5001",
    "student_name": "Emma Martin"
  },
  "prediction": 0,
  "recommendation": "Manual review recommended (low confidence)"
}
```

### 2. Frontend (demo.html)
**Modified displayBatchResults function** (lines 740-792)

**Before:**
- Displayed generic "Record 1", "Record 2", etc.

**After:**
- Checks for `identifiers` field in each result
- Extracts ID and name fields dynamically
- Displays as "ID - Name" format (e.g., "STU5001 - Emma Martin")
- Falls back to "Record N" if no identifiers found

**Display Format:**
```
STU5001 - Emma Martin
Prediction: Negative
Confidence: 67.7%
```

## How to Test

1. **Start the Flask API:**
   ```bash
   cd data_insight_ml
   python app.py
   ```
   Server runs on http://localhost:5000

2. **Open the Demo Interface:**
   - Open `demo.html` in your browser
   - Or navigate to http://localhost:5000 (if serving static files)

3. **Upload a Demo CSV:**
   - Select a domain (e.g., "Student Dropout Risk")
   - Click the upload area or drag-and-drop a CSV file
   - Use the provided demo files:
     - `demo_upload_student_dropout.csv` (STU5001-STU5015 with names)
     - `demo_upload_child_wellbeing.csv` (CHD6001-CHD6015 with names)
     - `demo_upload_donor_retention.csv` (DNR1001-DNR1015 with names)
     - `demo_upload_program_completion.csv` (PRT2001-PRT2015 with names)
     - `demo_upload_grant_scoring.csv` (GRT3001-GRT3015 with names)
     - `demo_upload_customer_churn.csv` (MBR4001-MBR4015 with names)

4. **Expected Results:**
   - Each prediction shows the ID and name (e.g., "STU5001 - Emma Martin")
   - Prediction result (Positive/Negative)
   - Confidence percentage
   - Visual confidence bar

## Demo CSV Files Available

- Sample: DNR1001 with donor name

### Program Completion (program_completion)
- File: `demo_upload_program_completion.csv`

## Technical Details

### ID Column Detection
Columns matching these patterns are treated as identifiers:
- Column name ends with `_id` (e.g., `student_id`, `donor_id`)
- Column name is exactly `id`

### Name Column Detection
Columns matching these patterns are treated as identifiers:
- Column name ends with `_name` (e.g., `student_name`, `donor_name`)
- Column name is exactly `name`

### Why This Approach?
Using `endswith('_id')` instead of `contains('id')` prevents false matches like:
- `behavioral_incidents` (contains "id" but not an identifier)
- `confidence` (contains "id" but not an identifier)
- `academic_record_id` (ends with "_id", correctly identified)

## API Test Example

```bash
# Test with curl
curl -X POST \
  -F "file=@demo_upload_student_dropout.csv" \
  -F "domain=student_dropout" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/upload-predict
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 15,
  "domain": "student_dropout",
  "results": [
    {
      "identifiers": {
        "student_id": "STU5001",
        "student_name": "Emma Martin"
      },
      "prediction": 0,
      "confidence": 0.6769654835787958,
      "recommendation": "Manual review recommended (low confidence)"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **app.py** (lines 483-518)
   - Enhanced ID/name column detection
   - Added identifiers to prediction results

2. **demo.html** (lines 740-792)
   - Updated batch results display
   - Shows ID and name instead of generic labels

## Status

✓ Backend API fixed and tested
✓ Frontend display updated
✓ All 6 domains tested and working
✓ Demo CSV files available with IDs and names
✓ Ready to use!

## Next Steps

1. Open demo.html in your browser
2. Select any domain
3. Upload the corresponding demo CSV
4. See IDs and names displayed in results!
