**A free, open-source machine learning toolkit designed for non-profits and NGOs to analyze their data and make predictions.**

## What is this?

Data Insight ML is a ready-to-use machine learning system that allows organizations to:
- Upload their own CSV data
- Automatically train prediction models
- Get insights and predictions through a web interface
- No ML expertise required!

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Try Pre-Trained Models (Fastest - 2 minutes)

**Perfect for exploring the toolkit with ready-to-use ML models!**

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Start the API Server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The server will start at http://localhost:5000 with 6 pre-trained models.

3. **Open the Web Interface**
   - Open `demo.html` in your web browser
   - Select a domain (Donor Retention, Student Dropout, etc.)
   - Try uploading `messy_student_data.csv` to see data cleaning in action
   - Or use the demo data for instant predictions!

### Option 2: Train Your Own Model

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Data**
   Place your CSV file in the `data_insight_ml` folder and run:
   ```bash
   python prepare_data.py your_data.csv
   ```

3. **Train Your Model**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
   This trains a machine learning model on your data (takes 2-5 minutes).

4. **Start the Prediction API**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Use the Web Interface**
   Open `demo.html` in your web browser to interact with your model!

## Data Requirements

Your CSV file should:
- Have a **target column** (the thing you want to predict, e.g., "success", "failure", "approved")
- Have at least 100 rows (more is better)
- Have relevant features (columns that might influence the outcome)

Example data structure:

```csv
applicant_id,age,income,education,region,credit_score,approved
1,25,35000,Bachelor,North,680,1
2,45,85000,Master,South,720,1
3,22,28000,High School,East,590,0
...
```

## Interactive Data Cleaning with Template Commands

The web interface includes powerful template commands for precise data cleaning:

### Available Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `FILTER: condition` | Keep only rows matching condition | `FILTER: age >= 18` |
| `FILL: column WITH value` | Fill missing values | `FILL: income WITH median` |
| `DROP: column` | Remove a column | `DROP: temp_column` |
| `REPLACE: column old WITH new` | Replace values | `REPLACE: gender M WITH Male` |
| `RENAME: old TO new` | Rename column | `RENAME: old_id TO new_id` |
| `CLIP: column min max` | Constrain values to range | `CLIP: age 0 120` |
| `# comment` | Add comments | `# Fix data quality issues` |

### Example Usage

See `example_cleaning_commands.txt` for complete examples. Here's a quick sample:

```
# Clean student data
FILTER: age >= 14
FILL: gpa WITH mean
FILL: attendance_rate WITH median
REPLACE: parent_involvement low WITH Low
CLIP: gpa 0 4.0
```

Commands are executed top-to-bottom. The cleaning log shows exactly what was done with color-coded feedback:
- ‚úì Green = Success
- ‚ö† Orange = Warning (column not found)
- ‚ùå Red = Error
- üìù Blue = Note/comment

## Configuration (Optional)

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Target column name
- Columns to exclude
- Model hyperparameters
- Feature engineering options

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
```
GET /api/health
```

### Make Prediction
```
POST /api/predict
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "feature1": value1,
  "feature2": value2,
  ...
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Feature Engineering

Edit `prepare_data.py` to add custom features specific to your domain.

### Model Selection

The toolkit automatically tries multiple models and selects the best one. You can customize this in `train_model.py`.

### Deployment

For production use:
1. Use `gunicorn` instead of Flask development server
2. Add authentication to your API
3. Set up HTTPS
4. Monitor model performance over time

## Common Use Cases

- **Donor Prediction**: Predict which donors are likely to give again
- **Program Success**: Predict which participants will complete programs
- **Resource Allocation**: Predict which areas need most resources
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-risk cases early
- **Application Scoring**: Score grant/aid applications automatically

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Model accuracy is low
- **Solution**: Add more data, check data quality, add relevant features

**Issue**: API won't start
- **Solution**: Check if port 5000 is available, verify all dependencies installed

**Issue**: Predictions seem wrong
- **Solution**: Verify your data format matches training data structure
